# Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Within Jupyter Notebook, we will utilize Pandas to read and clean the data, and then perform our initial analysis. 
More extensive study will later be executed using Numpy for advanced calculations and Plotly for visualization.

### Database Storage
We intend to use PostgreSQL as our database management system.

### Machine Learning
SciKit-Learn is the Machine Learning library for our project. We will apply the train_test_split technique and random forest for our 
supervised learning algorithm. Our goal with supervised learning is to learn a function that best approximates the relationship 
between observable input and output in our collected data. 

### Dashboard
We will present our process, analysis and results employing Google Slides
